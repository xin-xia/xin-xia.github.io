I am the Chief Expert of the Software Engineering Application Technology at Huawei, China. Prior to joining Huawei, I was  an ARC DECRA Fellow and a lecturer (equivalent to a U.S. assistant professor) at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia. I got my Ph.D degree in June 2014 from the College of Computer Science and Technology,  Zhejiang University, China.  I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of  Prof. Xiaohu Yang  and Prof. Jianling Sun. From July  2012 to January 2014, I was a visiting student of Prof. [David Lo] at Singapore Management University. I received the <strong>ACM SIGSOFT Early Career Researcher Award</strong> in 2022. 


To help developers and testers improve their productivity, my current research focuses on data science for software engineering, i.e., mining and analyzing
rich data in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information. I have employed and customized structured and unstructured data analytics techniques -- including data mining, information retrieval,
natural language processing, search-based algorithms, and program analysis -- to transform passive software
engineering data into automated tools and new insights.
