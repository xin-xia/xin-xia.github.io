I am  a lecturer (equivalent to U.S. assistant professor) at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia. Prior to joining Monash University, I was a post-doctoral research fellow in the software practices lab at the University of British Columbia in Canada,  with a specialization in software analytics and mining software repositories. My advisors are Prof. [Gail C. Murphy] and Prof. [Reid Holmes]. From 2014 to 2017, I was a research assistant professor at College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China.  

I got my Ph.D degree in June 2014 from College of Computer Science and Technology,  Zhejiang University, China.  I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of  Prof. Xiaohu Yang, and Prof. Jianling Sun. From July, 2012 to January,2014, I was a visiting student of Prof. [David Lo] in Singapore Management Universiy. 


To help developers and testers improve their productivity, my current research focuses on mining and analyzing
rich data in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information. I have employed and customized structured and unstructured data analytics techniques -- including data mining, information retrieval,
natural language processing, search-based algorithms, and program analysis -- to transform passive software
engineering data into automated tools and new insights.
