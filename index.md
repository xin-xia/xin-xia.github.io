I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia with
a specialization in software analytics and mining software repositories. My advisors are Prof. Gail Murphy and Prof. Reid Holmes. Prior to joining UBC, I was a research assistant professor at Zhejiang University in China. 

I got my Ph.D degree in June 2014 from College of Computer Science and Technology,  Zhejiang University, China.  I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of  Professor Xiaohu Yang, and Professor Jianling Sun. From July 1st , 2012 to January 1st ,2014, I was a visiting student of Professor David Lo in Singapore Management Universiy. 


To help developers and testers improve their productivity, my current research focuses on mining and analyzing
rich data in software repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information. I have employed and customized structured and unstructured data analytics techniques -- including data mining, information retrieval,
natural language processing, search-based algorithms, and program analysis -- to transform passive software
engineering data into automated tools and new insights.
